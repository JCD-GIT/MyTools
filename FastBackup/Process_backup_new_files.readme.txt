Process_backup_new_files is a simple program written in C# to backup only new files.
It is a fast way to backup picture and music files since this files are rarely modified after being created. 
It is not recommended for files that change like docs, xls since updated files are not copied/backed up.
For this type of files a full backup or another version verifying the content, slower to process, is recommended.

To use is very simple. See below:


Processa_backup_novos_arquivos.exe SOURCE_FOLDER TARGET_FOLDER MASK

E.g.

Processa_backup_novos_arquivos.exe c:\dados\fmv\music e:\backup\fmv\music *.MP3

 <h1>Juventude Transviada</h1>   
  <p>Lava roupa todo dia, que agonia<br>
Na quebrada da soleira, que chovia<br>
Até sonhar de madrugada, uma moça sem mancada<br>
Uma mulher não deve vacilar<br>
<br>
Eu entendo a juventude transviada<br>
E o auxílio luxuoso de um pandeiro<br>
Até sonhar de madrugada, uma moça sem mancada<br>
Uma mulher não deve vacilar<br>
<br>
Cada cara representa uma mentira<br>
Nascimento, vida e morte, quem diria<br>
Até sonhar de madrugada, uma moça sem mancada<br>
Uma mulher não deve vacilar<br>
<br>
Hoje pode transformar, e o que diria a juventude<br>
Um dia você vai chorar, vejo clara as fantasias</p>

   <!-- Translated Tile and Lyrics -->
 <h1>Wayward youth</h1>   
  <p>Hand-washing clothes everyday, such an agony<br>
In the split of the threshold, where it was raining<br>
Until the dreaming during the dawn, a lady with no mistakes<br>
A woman shouldn't have faults<br>
<br>
I understand the wayward youth<br>
And the luxury aid from a pandeiro (percussion instrument)<br>
Until the dreaming during the dawn, a lady with no mistakes<br>
A woman shouldn't have faults<br>
<br>
Each face represents a lie<br>
Birth, life and death, who would have said<br>
Until the dreaming during the dawn, a lady with no mistakes<br>
A woman shouldn't have faults<br>
<br>
The today can transform, and what would the youth say<br>
One day you're going to cry, I see clearly the fantasies</p>

 <!-- Info about the artist -->
  <h1>Who is Luiz Melodia</h1>   
  <p>Luiz Carlos dos Santos (born January 7, 1951), more commonly known as Luiz Melodia, is a Brazilian actor, singer and songwriter of MPB, rock, blues, soul and samba. Son of samba artist and songwriter Oswaldo Melodia (from whom he inherited his stage name), he grew up in the slum district of São Carlos, in the neighbourhood of Estácio, often referred to as the "Cradle of Samba". Since 1977, he has been married to singer, songwriter and producer Jane Reis and is the father of rap artist Mahal Reis (1980). His first LP, Pérola Negra, was released in 1973. He reached the finals of the Festival Abertura musical competition, hosted by Rede Globo, with his track "Ébano".
Over the last few decades, Melodia released a number of albums and performed extensively in Brazil and Europe. In 1987, he played in Châteauvallon, France, and in Bern, Switzerland. In 1992, he performed at the III Folcalquier Music Festival, in France, and, in 2004, at the Montreux Jazz Festival, on the banks of Lake Geneva, where he appeared at the Stravinsky Auditorium, the festival's main stage. He has performed in a number of European countries, including Germany, the UK, Denmark, France, Switzerland and Portugal. He played on the fourth solo album by Titãs member Sérgio Britto, released in September 2011 (Purabossanova).</p>

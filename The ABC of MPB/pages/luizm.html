 <h1>Magrelinha</h1>   
  <p>O por do sol vai renovar brilhar de novo o seu sorriso<br>
E libertar da areia preta e do arco-íris cor de sangue<br>
Cor de sangue, cor de sangue, cor de sangue...<br>
<br>
O beijo meu vem com melado decorado cor de rosa<br>
O sonho seu vem dos lugares mais distantes terras dos gigantes<br>
Super Homem, super mosca, Super Carioca, super eu, super eu ...<br>
<br>
Deixa tudo em forma é melhor não ser<br>
Não tem mais perigo digo já não sei<br>
Ela está comigo digo só não sei<br>
O sol não advinha baby é magrelinha<br>
O sol não adivinha baby é magrelinha<br>
<br>
No coração do Brasil<br>
No coração do Brasil<br>
No coração, no coração<br>
No coração do Brasil<br>
No coração, no coração</p>

   <!-- Translated Tile and Lyrics --> <h1>Magrelinha</h1>   
  <p>The sunset will renew your smile shine again<br>
And free from the black sand and the blood-colored rainbow <br>
Color of blood, color of blood, color of blood ... <br>
<br>
My kiss comes with pink decorated honeycomb <br>
Your dream comes from the farthest lands of the giants <br>
Super Man, super fly, Super Carioca, super I, super I ... <br>
<br>
Leaves everything in shape it's better not to be<br>
No more danger I say I do not know anymore<br>
She is with me I say just do not know <br>
The sun does not guess baby it's magrelinha <br>
The sun does not guess baby it's magrelinha <br>
<br>
Inside the heart of Brazil <br>
Inside the heart of Brazil <br>
Inside the heart, inside the heart <br>
Inside the heart of Brazil <br>
Inside the heart, inside the heart</p>

 <!-- Info about the artist -->
  <h1>Who is Luiz Melodia</h1>   
  <p>Luiz Carlos dos Santos (born January 7, 1951), more commonly known as Luiz Melodia, is a Brazilian actor, singer and songwriter of MPB, rock, blues, soul and samba. Son of samba artist and songwriter Oswaldo Melodia (from whom he inherited his stage name), he grew up in the slum district of São Carlos, in the neighbourhood of Estácio, often referred to as the "Cradle of Samba". Since 1977, he has been married to singer, songwriter and producer Jane Reis and is the father of rap artist Mahal Reis (1980). His first LP, Pérola Negra, was released in 1973. He reached the finals of the Festival Abertura musical competition, hosted by Rede Globo, with his track "Ébano".
Over the last few decades, Melodia released a number of albums and performed extensively in Brazil and Europe. In 1987, he played in Châteauvallon, France, and in Bern, Switzerland. In 1992, he performed at the III Folcalquier Music Festival, in France, and, in 2004, at the Montreux Jazz Festival, on the banks of Lake Geneva, where he appeared at the Stravinsky Auditorium, the festival's main stage. He has performed in a number of European countries, including Germany, the UK, Denmark, France, Switzerland and Portugal. He played on the fourth solo album by Titãs member Sérgio Britto, released in September 2011 (Purabossanova).</p>

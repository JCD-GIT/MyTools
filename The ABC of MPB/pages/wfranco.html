 <h1>Canalha</h1>   
  <p>É uma dor canalha<br>
Que te dilacera<br>
É um grito que se espalha<br>
Também pudera<br>
Não tarda nem falha<br>
Apenas te espera<br>
Num campo de batalha<br>
É um grito que se espalha<br>
É uma dor<br>
Canalha</p>

 <h1>Scoundrel</h1>   
  <p>It's a scumbag pain<br>
To tear you apart<br>
It is a cry that spreads<br>
I could also<br>
It does not take long or fail<br>
Just waiting for you<br>
On a battlefield<br>
It is a cry that spreads<br>
It's a pain<br>
Scoundrel</p>

 <!-- Info about the artist -->
  <h1>Who is Walter Franco</h1>   
  <p>Walter Rosciano Franco (São Paulo, January 6, 1945) is a singer-songwriter from São Paulo.
He did not participate in any musical cultural movement, such as bossa nova or tropicalismo, but he was always in the vanguard, at various times.
It was already part of the Vanguarda Paulista, even before the expression was coined by the generation of Arrigo Barnabé and Itamar Assumpção. He worked with arrangers like Rogério Duprat and Júlio Medaglia, and had the lyrics of the song "Cabeça" translated into English by Augusto de Campos. His most critically acclaimed album is Revolver [1], 1975.
The composer has at least five songs well known to the general public: the "Cabeça", "Seja Feita a Vontade do Povo", "Coração Tranquilo", "Respire Fundo" and "Vela Aberta", the latter being performed to this day in Radio-flash programs.
Another success of Walter Franco is "Serra do Luar", with a striking refrain: "To live is to tune the instrument / From inside to outside / From outside to inside".
Walter Franco has been re-recorded by artists such as Leila Pinheiro, Oswaldo Montenegro and Chico Buarque, as well as rock bands such as Ira !, Venus, Pato Fu and Titãs who also recorded songs by the composer.
Walter Franco is currently vice president of Abramus - Brazilian Association of Music and Arts, a copyright collecting society affiliated with ECAD</p>

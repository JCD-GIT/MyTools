 <h1> Construção</h1>   
  <p> Amou daquela vez como se fosse a última<br>
Beijou sua mulher como se fosse a última<br>
E cada filho seu como se fosse o único<br>
E atravessou a rua com seu passo tímido<br>
Subiu a construção como se fosse máquina<br>
Ergueu no patamar quatro paredes sólidas<br>
Tijolo com tijolo num desenho mágico<br>
Seus olhos embotados de cimento e lágrima<br>
Sentou pra descansar como se fosse sábado<br>
Comeu feijão com arroz como se fosse um príncipe<br>
Bebeu e soluçou como se fosse um náufrago<br>
Dançou e gargalhou como se ouvisse música<br>
E tropeçou no céu como se fosse um bêbado<br>
E flutuou no ar como se fosse um pássaro<br>
E se acabou no chão feito um pacote flácido<br>
Agonizou no meio do passeio público<br>
Morreu na contramão atrapalhando o tráfego<br>
<br>
Amou daquela vez como se fosse o último<br>
Beijou sua mulher como se fosse a única<br>
E cada filho seu como se fosse o pródigo<br>
E atravessou a rua com seu passo bêbado<br>
Subiu a construção como se fosse sólido<br>
Ergueu no patamar quatro paredes mágicas<br>
Tijolo com tijolo num desenho lógico<br>
Seus olhos embotados de cimento e tráfego<br>
Sentou pra descansar como se fosse um príncipe<br>
Comeu feijão com arroz como se fosse o máximo<br>
Bebeu e soluçou como se fosse máquina<br>
Dançou e gargalhou como se fosse o próximo<br>
E tropeçou no céu como se ouvisse música<br>
E flutuou no ar como se fosse sábado<br>
E se acabou no chão feito um pacote tímido<br>
Agonizou no meio do passeio náufrago<br>
Morreu na contramão atrapalhando o público<br>
<br>
Amou daquela vez como se fosse máquina<br>
Beijou sua mulher como se fosse lógico<br>
Ergueu no patamar quatro paredes flácidas<br>
Sentou pra descansar como se fosse um pássaro<br>
E flutuou no ar como se fosse um príncipe<br>
E se acabou no chão feito um pacote bêbado<br>
Morreu na contra-mão atrapalhando o sábado<br>
<br>
Por esse pão pra comer, por esse chão pra dormir<br>
A certidão pra nascer e a concessão pra sorrir<br>
Por me deixar respirar, por me deixar existir<br>
Deus lhe pague<br>
<br>
Pela cachaça de graça que a gente tem que engolir<br>
Pela fumaça e a desgraça, que a gente tem que tossir<br>
Pelos andaimes pingentes que a gente tem que cair<br>
Deus lhe pague<br>
<br>
Pela mulher carpideira pra nos louvar e cuspir<br>
E pelas moscas bicheiras a nos beijar e cobrir<br>
E pela paz derradeira que enfim vai nos redimir<br>
Deus lhe pague<br>

 <h1> Construction</h1>   
  <p>He made love as if it were the last time<br>
Kissed his woman as if she were the last one<br>
And each child as if they were the only ones<br>
And he crossed the street with his shy step<br>
He climbed the construction site as if he were a machine<br>
He built in the landing four solid walls<br>
Brick by brick in a magical design<br>
His eyes dulled by the concrete and tears<br>
He sat down to rest as though it were Saturday<br>
He ate beans and rice as though he were a prince<br>
Then drank and sobbed as though he were a castaway<br>
He danced and laughed as if he were listening to music<br>
And he stumbled in the sky as though he were a drunk<br>
And he floated in the air as though he were a bird<br>
And he finished on the ground in a messy heap<br>
He agonized in the middle of the public sidewalk<br>
He died going the wrong way interrupting the traffic<br>
<br>
He made love that time as if he were the last one<br>
He kissed his woman as if she were the only one<br>
And each child as if they were the prodigy<br>
And he crossed the street with his drunken step<br>
He climbed the construction site as if it were solid<br>
He built in the landing four magical walls<br>
Brick by brick in a logical design<br>
His eyes dulled by the concrete and traffic<br>
He sat down to rest as though he were a prince<br>
He ate beans and rice as if it were the best<br>
He drank and sobbed as if he were a machine<br>
He danced and laughed as if he were the next one<br>
And he stumbled in the sky as though listening to music<br>
And he floated in the air as if it were Saturday<br>
And finished on the ground in a shy heap<br>
He agonized in the middle of the castaway sidewalk<br>
He died going the wrong way interrupting the public<br>
<br>
He made love that time as if he were a machine<br>
He kissed his woman as if it were logical<br>
He built in the landing four flaccid walls<br>
He sat down to rest as if he were a bird<br>
And he floated in the air as if he were a prince<br>
And finished on the ground in a drunken heap<br>
He died going the wrong way interrupting Saturday<br>
<br>
For this bread to eat, for this ground to sleep<br>
The birth certificate and the license to smile<br>
For letting me breathe, for letting me exist<br>
God shall reward you<br>
<br>
For the free liquor that we all have to swallow<br>
For the smoke and the misfortune, that we all have to cough<br>
For the hanging scaffold from which we all have to fall<br>
God shall reward you<br>
<br>
For the moaning woman to praise us and spit at us<br>
And for the flies to kiss us and cover us<br>
And for the final peace that in the end will redeem us<br>
God shall reward you</p>

  <h1>Who is Chico Buarque?</h1>   
  <p>
		Francisco "Chico" Buarque de Hollanda (born June 19, 1944 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), popularly known simply as Chico Buarque (Brazilian Portuguese: [ˈʃiku buˈaʁki]), is a Brazilian singer-songwriter, guitarist, composer, playwright, writer and poet. He is best known for his music, which often includes social, economic and cultural commentary on Brazil in general and Rio de Janeiro in particular.
The firstborn son of Sérgio Buarque de Hollanda, Buarque lived at several locations throughout his childhood, though mostly in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Rome, Italy. He wrote and studied literature as a child and found music through the bossa nova compositions of Tom Jobim and João Gilberto. He performed as a singer and guitarist the 1960s as well as writing a play that was deemed dangerous by the Brazilian military dictatorship of the time. Buarque, along with several Tropicalist and MPB musicians, was threatened by the Brazilian military government and eventually left Brazil for Italy in 1969. However, he came back to Brazil in 1970, and continued to record, perform, and write, though much of his material was suppressed by government censors. He released several more albums in the 1980s and published three novels in the 1990s and 2000s.

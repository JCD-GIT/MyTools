 <h1>Foi um rio que passou em minha vida</h1>   
  <p>Se um dia<br>
Meu coração for consultado<br>
Para saber se andou errado<br>
Será difícil negar<br>
Meu coração<br>
Tem mania de amor<br>
Amor não é fácil de achar<br>
A marca dos meus desenganos<br>
Ficou, ficou<br>
Só um amor pode apagar<br>
A marca dos meus desenganos<br>
Ficou, ficou<br>
Só um amor pode apagar...<br>
<br>
Porém! Ai porém!<br>
Há um caso diferente<br>
Que marcou num breve tempo<br>
Meu coração para sempre<br>
Era dia de Carnaval<br>
Carregava uma tristeza<br>
Não pensava em novo amor<br>
Quando alguém<br>
Que não me lembro anunciou<br>
Portela, Portela<br>
O samba trazendo alvorada<br>
Meu coração conquistou...<br>
<br>
Ah! Minha Portela!<br>
Quando vi você passar<br>
Senti meu coração apressado<br>
Todo o meu corpo tomado<br>
Minha alegria voltar<br>
Não posso definir<br>
Aquele azul<br>
Não era do céu<br>
Nem era do mar<br>
Foi um rio que passou em minha vida<br>
E meu coração se deixou levar<br>
Foi um rio que passou em minha vida<br>
E meu coração se deixou levar<br>
Foi um rio que passou em minha vida<br>
E meu coração se deixou levar!</p>

 <h1>Was a river went throught my life</h1>   
  <p>If one day<br>
My heart is consulted<br>
To know if went wrong<br>
It'll be hard deny<br>
My heart<br>
Has love mania<br>
Love doesn't be easy to find<br>
The mark of my disappointments<br>
Stayed, stayed<br>
Only one love can erase it<br>
The mark of my disappointments<br>
Stayed, stayed<br>
Only one love can erase it<br>
<br>
However! Oh however!<br>
There is an different case<br>
That marked in a brief time<br>
My heart forever<br>
It was Carnival day<br>
Carried a sorrow<br>
Doesn't thought in new love<br>
When somebody<br>
Who I don't remember announced<br>
Portela, Portela<br>
The samba bringing dawn<br>
My heart conquered<br>
<br> 
Oh! My Portela!<br>
When I saw you passing<br>
I felt my heart rushed<br>
All my body taken<br>
My happiness coming back<br>
I can't define<br>
That blue<br>
Wasn't from sky<br>
Wasn't from sea<br>
Was a river went throught my life<br>
And my heart let itself taken<br>
Was a river went throught my life<br>
And my heart let itself taken<br>
Was a river went throught my life<br>
And my heart let itself taken!</p>

 <!-- Info about the artist -->
  <h1>Who is Paulinho da Viola</h1>   
  <p>Paulinho da Viola (born Paulo César Batista de Faria on November 12, 1942) (Portuguese pronunciation: [pawˈlĩɲʊ daviˈɔlɐ]) is a Brazilian sambista, singer/songwriter, guitar, cavaquinho and mandolin player, known for his sophisticated harmonies and soft, gentle singing voice. Born in Rio de Janeiro to a family deeply rooted in the samba tradition, Paulinho met and befriended much of Rio's samba elite as a child. His father was a guitar player and musicians like Pixinguinha and Jacob do Bandolim would often come to his house for rehearsals, which Paulinho watched for hours on end. After the rehearsals, Paulinho would pick up his father's guitar and strum the few chords he knew. Later, as a teenager, he was frequently seen at jams at mandolin master Jacob do Bandolim's house, quietly and attentively observing the older, more experienced musicians. He began writing his own songs as a teenager, but never considered a career as a professional musician until he met poet Hermínio Bello de Carvalho in 1964. By then, Paulinho was working as a teller at a bank in Rio de Janeiro, and recognized Hermínio from the jam sessions at Jacob do Bandolim's house. The two became close friends and soon began writing music together. The first song they wrote together was Duvide-o-dó, recorded by singer Isaurinha Garcia. He then began performing his own songs at a restaurant in Rio, owned by samba legend Cartola and his wife.</p>

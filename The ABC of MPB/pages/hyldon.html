 <h1>Na Sombra de uma Árvore</h1>   
  <p>Larga de ser boba e vem comigo<br>
Existe um mundo novo e quero te mostrar<br>
Que não se aprende em nenhum livro<br>
Basta ter coragem pra se libertar, viver, amar<br>
De que valem as luzes da cidade<br>
Se no meu caminho a luz é natural<br>
Descansar na sombra de uma árvore<br>
Ouvindo os pássaros cantar, cantar, é...</p>

<h1>In the Shade of a Tree </h1>
   <P>Stop being silly and come with me <br>
There is a new world and I want to show you <br>
What you will not learn in any book <br>
Just have the courage to break free, live, love <br>
What are the worth of city lights?<br>
If in my way the light is natural <br>
Rest in the shade of a tree <br>
Listening to the birds singing, singing, ... </ p>

 <!-- Info about the artist -->
  <h1>Who is Hyldon</h1>   
  <p>Hyldon de Souza Silva (Salvador, April 17, 1951) is a producer, guitarist, bassist, composer and Brazilian singer of the soul genre. 
  Having worked with music since he was 14, he was instrumentalist at the beginning of his career, having passed the composer and producer as he was maturing. 
  Its popularity was very great in the 70's with the launch of its biggest and also first success, the song "Na rua, na chuva, na fazenda"  Farm", title of its first album. Its popularity declined in 
  the following years, fruit of divergence with record companies, but he always continued recording, composing and making shows by the country. There was a resurgence with 
  the rediscovery of their music by younger artists and the post-revival cinema.<br>
  <br>
His most well-known songs are the aforementioned 
"Na Rua, na Chuva, na Fazenda (Casinha de Sapê)", "As Dores do Mundo", "Na Sombra de uma Árvore", "Acontecimento" and "Velho Camarada" with Tim Maia and Fabio. 
Together with the first and Cassian is considered one of the forerunners of Brazilian black music.
<br>
Hyldon was born in Salvador, but at the age of six months, his family moved to a town in Bahia, called Senhor do Bonfim, almost on the state border with Pernambuco. 
There, the future singer and guitarist lived seven years, when the whole family moved to Rio de Janeiro.</p>

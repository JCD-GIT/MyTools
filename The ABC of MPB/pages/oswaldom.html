 <h1>Por Brilho</h1>   
  <p>Onde vá<br>
Onde quer que vá<br>
Leva o coração feliz<br>
Toca a flauta da alegria<br>
Como doce menestrel<br>
<br>
Onde vá<br>
Onde quer que eu vá<br>
Vou estar de olho atento<br>
À tua menor tristeza<br>
Por no teu sorriso o mel<br>
<br>
Onde vá<br>
Vá para ser estrela<br>
As coisas se transformam<br>
Isso não é bom nem mal<br>
E onde quer que eu esteja<br>
O nosso amor tem brilho<br>
Vou ver o teu sinal</p>

   <!-- Translated Tile and Lyrics -->
 <h1>For Shinning</h1>
 <p>Where you go<br>
Wherever you go <br>
Takes your hearth happy<br>
Plays the flute of joy <br>
How sweet minstrel <br>
<br>
Where you go <br>
Wherever I go <br>
I'll keep my eye out <br>
In case your smallest sign of sadness <br>
I will put honey in your smile<br>
<br>
Where you go <br>
Go to be a star <br>
Things can change <br>
This is not good or bad <br>
And wherever I am <br>
Our love has shine <br>
I'll see your sign</p>

  <h1>Who is Oswaldo Montenegro</h1>   
  <p>Oswaldo Viveiros Montenegro (Rio de Janeiro, March 15, 1956) is a Brazilian musician. In addition to being a singer, Montenegro has composed soundtracks for plays, ballets, film and television[1] and were married to actress Paloma Duarte. It has one of the stronger partnerships MPB beside Madalena Salles, accompanying with their flutes.
  Born in the Grajaú neighborhood, Oswaldo is an exceptional case of musical precocity. Without ever having studied music regularly, he began from early childhood to be influenced by it. First, at her parents' house in Rio de Janeiro: her mother and her parents played the piano, her father played the guitar and sang.
The second influence was stronger. When he was eight years old, he moved with his parents to São João del-Rei, a poetic and bohemian mining town, where serenades happened every night and people joined friends at home to spend their evenings playing and singing. At the same time, Oswaldo was attracted to the baroque music of the churches. At this time, he took lessons in guitar with one of the city's serenaders and composed his first song, Lenheiro, name of the river that bathes São João del-Rei. He won a music festival with only 13 years, in Rio de Janeiro, where he returned to live.
The decision to become a professional musician came with the move to Brasilia in 1971. In the federal capital, he began to contact festivals and student theater and dance groups. He made his first shows and at age 17 the decision to live the music became definitive. He moved again to Rio, but he had already adopted Brasilia as the land of his heart and the constant theme of his work. Also his preferred partners were friends he made there, such as José Alexandre, Mongol and Madalena Salles, among others.
It was also in Brasilia that he made contact with erudite music in the concerts of the National Theater. Not only does he attend concerts with his musician friends, among them maestro Otávio Maul and the Prista Tavares family, but he goes in the middle of the night talking about musical technique and theory. Self-taught, devour books on the history of music.  </p>

 <h1>Primeiros Erros</h1>   
  <p>Meu caminho é cada manhã<br>
Não procure saber onde vou<br>
Meu destino não é de ninguém<br>
E eu não deixo os meus passos no chão<br>
Se você não entende não vê<br>
Se não me vê não entende<br>
<br>
Não procure saber onde estou<br>
Se o meu jeito te surpreende<br>
Se o meu corpo virasse sol<br>
Se a minha mente virasse sol<br>
Mas só chove, chove<br>
<br>
Se um dia eu pudesse ver<br>
Meu passado inteiro<br>
E fizesse parar de chover<br>
Nos primeiros erros<br>
Meu corpo viraria sol<br>
Minha mente viraria sol<br>
Mas só chove, chove<br>
Chove, chove<br>
<br>
Se um dia eu pudesse ver<br>
Meu passado inteiro<br>
E fizesse parar de chover<br>
Nos primeiros erros<br>
Meu corpo viraria sol<br>
Minha mente viraria sol<br>
Mas só chove, chove<br>
Chove, chove</p>

 <h1>Early mistakes</h1>   
  <p><p>My way is in every new morning<br>
Don't try to know my whereabouts<br>
My destiny belongs to no one<br>
I never leave footprints on the way<br>
If you don't understand it, you can't see it<br>
If you don't see me, you can't understand me<br>
<br>
Don't try to know my whereabouts<br>
In case my nature surprises you<br>
If only my body could turn into sunlight<br>
If only my mind could turn into sunlight<br>
But here there is only rain<br>
Nothing but rain<br>
<br>
If once I could ever see<br>
My past again<br>
If once I could stop this rain<br>
That is falling over my early mistakes<br>
My body, then, would turn into sunlight<br>
My mind would turn into sunlight<br>
But here, there is only rain<br>
Nothing but rain<br>
<br>
If once I could ever see<br>
My past again<br>
If once I could stop this rain<br>
That is falling over my early mistakes<br>
My body, then, would turn into sunlight<br>
My mind would turn into sunlight<br>
But here there is only rain<br>
Nothing but rain</p></p>

 <!-- Info about the artist -->
  <h1>Who is Kiko Zambianchi</h1>   
  <p>Kiko Zambianchi (Francisco José Zambianchi) born in Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo state. He is a Brazilian composer and singer.<br>
  He started playing guitar during his teenage years, having participated in student festivals and theater plays, did shows in the interior, 
  formed the band Vida de Rua and, at age 23, moved to São Paulo where he was hired in a month by EMI .<br>

He released, at the end of 1984, the single of "Rolam as Pedras", that burst in the radios of São Paulo and later in all Brazil. 
After that, Zambianchi launches, by EMI, the LP Shock, which has recorded three hits: the title track, "Rolam as Pedras". 
With participation of Lulu Santos and Marina Lima in the songs "Nossa Energia" and "Quem sofre sou eu", respectively. 
"No meio da rua", another track of the album, enters the soundtrack of the program Armação Limitada of Rede Globo. 
Marina Lima records "I love you" by Kiko and bursts into the radio stations all over the country, and in the same year, 
Erasmo Carlos records another song composed by Zambianchi called "Manchas e Intrigas". "Primeiros Erros" was a song practically 
discarded by the label, which, after the success of "Rolam as Pedras" and "Shock", wanted Kiko already to leave for the recording of a 
new album. But Kiko, believing in the success of the song, made personal divulgation of the song, going to the radio stations of the great São Paulo 
with the disc to be played, and gradually the music began to be known and performed, and reached the top of the charts in all Brazil.<br><br>

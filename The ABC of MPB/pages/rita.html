 <h1>Bobos da Côrte</h1>   
  <p>Eu vou puxar você<br>
Pra perto de mim,<br>
E dar um amasso daqueles<br>
Que não dá pra dizer,<br>
Se ele é ela ou se ela é ele!<br>
<br>
Eu vou beijar você<br>
Debaixo do seu nariz,<br>
No meio da bôca da noite,<br>
Nem rainha, nem rei<br>
Apenas bobos da côrte</p>

   <!-- Translated Tile and Lyrics -->
 <h1>Clowns of the Court</h1>   
  <p>I'll pull you<br>
Near me,<br>
And give those great hugs<br>
That's not to possible to say,<br>
If he is her or if she is him<br>
<br>
I will kiss you<br>
Under your nose,<br>
In the middle of the night ("night mouth"),<br>
Neither queen nor king<br>
Only clowns of the court</p>

 <h1>Saudosa Maloca</h1>   
  <p>Si o senhor não está lembrado<br>
Dá licença de contá<br>
Que aqui onde agora está<br>
Esse edifício arto<br>
Era uma casa velha<br>
Um palacete assobradado<br>
<br>
Foi aqui seu moço<br>
Que eu, Mato Grosso e o Joca<br>
Construímos nossa maloca<br>
Mais, um dia<br>
Nós nem pode se alembrar<br>
Veio os homi cas ferramenta<br>
Que o dono mandô derrubá<br>
<br>
Peguemo todas nossas coisa<br>
E fumos pro meio da rua<br>
Apreciar a demolição<br>
Que tristeza que nós sentia<br>
Cada táuba que caía<br>
Doía no coração<br>
<br>
Mato Grosso quis gritá<br>
Mas em cima eu falei:<br>
Os homi tá cá razão<br>
Nós arranja outro lugar<br>
<br>
Só se conformemo quando o Joca falou:<br>
"Deus dá o frio conforme o cobertor"<br>
E hoje nóis pega a páia nas grama do jardim<br>
<br>
E prá esquecê nóis cantemos assim:<br>
Saudosa maloca, maloca querida,<br>
Que dim donde nóis passemos dias feliz de nossa vida<br>
  <br>
  <br>

 <h1>Missing Simple Home</h1>
  <p>If you do not remember <br>
Let me tell you<br>
Here where<br>
This tall building is<br>
there was an old house <br>
A lofted mansion<br>
<br>
Man, it was here<br>
That I, Mato Grosso and Joca <br>
Built our maloca (simple house) <br>
But, one day <br>
We can not even remember <br>
The men came with their tools<br>
The boss ask to put down <br>
<br>
We took all our things <br>
And went to the middle of the street <br>
To appreciate the demolition <br>
So sad, we felt <br>
Each brick that was falling <br>
hurted my heart<br>
<br>
Mato Grosso wanted to scream <br>
But I stop him and said<br>
The men are right<br>
We find somewhere else to live<br>
<br>
We just conform when Joca said<br>
"God gives the cold according to the blanket" <br>
And today we pick up the straw in the grass of the garden <br>
<br>
And to forget it, we sing like this<br>
My missing Maloca, My dear Maloca<br>
Where we spent happy days of our life<br></p>
   <br>
  <br>

 <!-- Info about the artist -->
  <h1>Who was Adoniran Barbosa</h1>   
  <p>Adoniran Barbosa, artistic name of João Rubinato (6 August 1910, Valinhos - 23 November 1982, São Paulo), was a noted Brazilian São Paulo style samba singer and composer.<br>In spite of the success of his songs and radio characters, Adoniran only became a star of sorts after 1973 when he recorded his first own album. That made him respected as a major composer, and gave him some media exposure. Nevertheless, through his career he continued living a simple and happy life. He had earned a private table at the Bar Brahma, one of the city's most traditional bars.
While he never lost his love of São Paulo, towards the end of his life he became increasingly sad about the disappearance of its traditional character. "Until the 1960s," he once said, "São Paulo still existed, but since then I have been looking for it, and could not find it. Brás, where is Brás now? And Bexiga, where is it? I was told to look for the Sé. Could not find it. All I see is cars and concrete."
While his music continued to be played, Adoniran himself was gradually forgotten by the public; so that when he died in 1982, in relative poverty, he had at his side only his wife and a brother in law. However, almost 30 years after his death he is still remembered by popular Brazilian singers like Perci Guzzo, who occasionally performs his songs in tribute.

 <h1> Refazenda</h1>   
  <p>Abacateiro acataremos teu ato<br>
Nós também somos do mato como o pato e o leão<br>
Aguardaremos brincaremos no regato<br>
Até que nos tragam frutos teu amor, teu coração<br>
Abacateiro teu recolhimento é justamente<br>
O significado da palavra temporão<br>
Enquanto o tempo não trouxer teu abacate<br>
Amanhecerá tomate e anoitecerá mamão<br>
Abacateiro sabes ao que estou me referindo<br>
Porque todo tamarindo tem o seu agosto azedo<br>
Cedo, antes que o janeiro doce manga venha ser também<br>
Abacateiro serás meu parceiro solitário<br>
Nesse itinerário da leveza pelo ar<br>
Abacateiro saiba que na refazenda<br>
Tu me ensina a fazer renda que eu te ensino a namorar<br>
Refazendo tudo<br>
Refazenda<br>
Refazenda toda<br>

 <h1>Farm Again</h1>   
  <p>Avocado tree, we acepte what you did<br>
We are also from the woods as the duck and the lion<br>
we will wait, we'll play in the stream<br>
Until they bringus fruit, your love, your heart<br>
Avocado tree, your gathering is precisely<br>
The meaning of the word hasty<br>
As time does not bring your avocado<br>
Dawn tomato and The night will fall papaya<br>
Avocado tree, you know what I mean<br>
For every tamarind has its August sour<br>
Early, before the sweet mango, January will also be<br>
Avocado tree, shalt be my lonely partner<br>
In this journey of lightness in the air<br>
Avocado tree, know that in Refazenda<br>
You teach me how to make lace and I'll teach you how to dating<br>
redoing everything<br>
Refazenda<br>
Refazenda all<br>
guariroba</p>

 <!-- Info about the artist -->
  <h1>Who is Gilberto Gil</h1>   
  <p>Gilberto Passos Gil Moreira (born 26 June 1942), better known as Gilberto Gil (Brazilian Portuguese: [ʒiɫˈbɛxtu ʒiɫ] or [ʒiu̯ˈbɛɾtʊ ʒiu̯]), is a Brazilian singer, guitarist, and songwriter, known for both his musical innovation and political commitment. From 2003 to 2008, he served as Brazil's Minister of Culture in the administration of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Gil's musical style incorporates an eclectic range of influences, including Rock music, Brazilian genres including samba, African music, and reggae.
Gil started to play music as a child and was still a teenager when he joined his first band. He began his career as a bossa nova musician, and then grew to write songs that reflected a focus on political awareness and social activism. He was a key figure in the Música popular brasileira and tropicália movements of the 1960s, alongside artists such as longtime collaborator Caetano Veloso. The Brazilian military regime that took power in 1964 saw both Gil and Veloso as a threat, and the two were held for nine months in 1969 before they were told to leave the country. Gil moved to London, but returned to Bahia in 1972 and continued his musical career, as well as working as a politician and environmental advocate.</p>
